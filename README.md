# **Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming**

Welcome to the repository for Week 2 of our Java learning journey. This week focused on understanding the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, enabling us to write modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

## **Overview**

In this week, we explored how Java implements the core OOP concepts including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. We learned how to model real-world entities as Java classes, utilize constructors, work with different types of variables, and structure our programs with robust class hierarchies.

## **Topics Covered**

### **Day 1: Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals**

* What is Object-Oriented Programming?  
* Four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism  
* Benefits of OOP in software development  
* Classes and objects in Java  

### **Day 2: Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers**

* Declaring and using constructors  
* Constructor overloading  
* Instance (object-level) vs. class (static) variables  
* Access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`, default)  

### **Day 3: `this`, `static`, `final` Keywords and `instanceof` Operator**

* Using `this` keyword to refer to the current object  
* The role of `static` in variables and methods  
* Defining constants using `final`  
* Checking object type with `instanceof`  

### **Day 4: Object Modeling and Class Diagram**

* Introduction to object modeling  
* Understanding and drawing class diagrams (UML basics)  
* Representing relationships: association, aggregation, composition  
* Real-world modeling examples  

### **Day 5: Inheritance**

* Concept of inheritance and code reuse  
* `extends` keyword  
* Method overriding  
* The `super` keyword  
* Types of inheritance supported by Java  

### **Day 6: Encapsulation, Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism**

* Encapsulation using getters and setters  
* Defining and implementing interfaces  
* Abstract classes vs. interfaces  
* Method overriding and dynamic method dispatch  
* Real-world examples of polymorphism  

## **Prerequisites**

* Completion of Week 1: Java Basics  
* Familiarity with Java syntax, data types, and control structures  
* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed  
* An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code  

## **How to Use This Repository**

This repository is structured to reflect the topics covered each day. You can find code examples, notes, or exercises within the respective daily folders (if available). Feel free to explore the code, run it, and modify it to deepen your understanding.

## **Next Steps**

In Week 3, we will delve into more advanced Java concepts such as exception handling, file I/O, and collections framework. Stay tuned!
